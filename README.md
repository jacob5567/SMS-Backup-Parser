# SMS-Backup-Parser

Written in Python 3, this program will parse and process XML data taken from the [SMS Backup & Restore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore) app, allowing it to be output to a file, or to a GUI program (hopefully).
This project came out of my own desire to backup my SMS messages in a format that can be easily stored and viewed.
